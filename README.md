# clipper
A game about paperclips.

## Running the game
Since we're not ready for prime-time yet, you have to be a turbo-nerd Rust developer to do it. If you'd like to also be a turbo-nerd Rust developer, simply head to [The Rust toolchain installer](https://rustup.rs/) to get started.

Once you're done, clone the repo and start the game with:

```shell
cargo run
```

You'll want to also make sure you've got [the Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed too.

## How to play the game
Since we don't have a tutorial or really any sort of useful content in the game, check out the [how to play guide](HOW-TO-PLAY.md).
