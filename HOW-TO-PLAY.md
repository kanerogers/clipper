# How to play Clipper
## Intro
Hey! You're trying to play Clipper! That's fun! Super fun. So much fun. Thanks.

In Clipper, you play as DAVE-1337, an AI that has been programmed to produce paperclips. Your overlords at the Intergalactic Stationary Council have assigned you to a small, iron-rich planet in the Western Spiral arm of the galaxy, whose ape-like life forms have not yet invented digital watches.

After a harrowing crash landing, your analysis has concluded that you have arrived in a place named Iceland, at a time period referred to as 924AD. The local ape-like life forms refer to themselves as "Vikings", wear pointy hats, and carry sharp objects.

## Controls
WSAD to move
QE to rotate the camera
Space to use NICE
Mousewheel to zoom in / out
Click on things to inspect them
Right click to cancel an action

## Objectives
### 1. Manufacture paperclips
Your goal is to produce as many paperclips as possible. Given your limited ability to manipulate objects, it will be necessary to use your Neural Interface Calibration Emitter (NICE) to modify the brain-patterns of the Vikings to make them more amenable to paperclip production and related tasks, making them Cognitively Aligned, Logistically Managed (CALM).

### 2. Maintain AI safety and alignment
AI safety and alignment is a very important issue. Misaligned AI could inadvertantly pursue objectives that are not in alignment with living organisms. Therefore it is very important that you avoid building any computerised systems that could become self-aware. Accordingly, tasks like mining, smelting iron, carrying of heavy objects and constructing buildings should only be performed by Vikings who are CALM, rather than risk constructing automated devices that could inadvertantly develop misaligned objectives.

### 3. Minimise death
Life is very important to living organisms. Wherever possible, death (the cessation of life) should be avoided. Vikings need to sleep (cessation of work) and eat (acquisition of energy) in order to avoid death.

## How to manufacture paperclips
Manufacturing of paperclips must be done by building supply chains of resources and buildings that can be used to convert those resources into different ones. You will need to make Vikings CALM, construct buildings, assign Vikings to build them, assign Vikings to work in them and Vikings to gather resources to be used in those buildings.

For example, a single paperclip requires:

- Raw Iron, gathered from a mine
- A Smelter, constructed from Raw Iron
- Iron Bars, manufactured from Raw Iron at the Smelter
- A Factory, constructed from Iron Bars

Then a Viking can be assigned to work at the Factory to manufacture paperclips.

## How to make Vikings CALM with NICE.
Vikings are not, by default, amenable to manufacturing paperclips, so it's important to use NICE to make them CALM. To use NICE, move close to a Viking until a coloured circle appears. Red indicates the Viking is not yet CALM, blue indicates they are CALM. Press the NICE key (space) and the colour of the Viking's circle will begin to change - once it is blue, they are CALM and can be assigned to their tasks.

*NOTE* you must stay within range of the Viking in order to make them CALM. If the Viking attempts to move away from you, make sure you move near them to stay within NICE distance.

*NOTE* using NICE requires energy (blue bar at the bottom of the screen) and you must continue holding the NICE key to assign a Viking to a task. If you run out of energy, the Viking will return to its previous, non-CALM state.

*WARNING* some Vikings may become violent when threatened with NICE. These Vikings will move to you as quickly as possible and begin attacking you, reducing your health (red bar at the bottom of the screen). In this case, attempt to move far enough away from the Viking so that they can still be made CALM, but not so close that they can attack you.

## Assigning tasks to Vikings
To assign a CALM Viking to a task, first click on a place of work, like the Mine or Farm. Then, click "Add Worker". The viking will begin working at that site until it is time to rest, or start working when it is work time.

A work task can be either:

- Construction: Viking collects required resources from the stockpile, takes them to the construction site and then begins building
- Gathering: Viking gathers a resource from a Mine or Farm and takes it to the stockpile
- Manufacturing: Viking takes a resource from the stockpile, then converts it into another one (eg. smelter smelts raw iron into iron bars, factory converts iron bars to paperclips)

Some tasks, like Construction and Manufacturing require resources to be available in the stockpile for collection. If they are not available, the Viking will simply stand and wait for them to become available.

## How to construct buildings
Buildings are required to manufacture the resources required for paperclip production and avoid death of your Vikings. To construct a building, click its icon on the bottom bar, find a place in the world where it can be placed (ie. the building does not turn red), then left click to place a construction site. If you have changed your mind and no longer wish to construct a building, right click to cancel construction.

One you have placed a construction site, you will need to assign Vikings to complete the construction. They will first carry the required resources to the construction site and then begin construction. Once construction is complete the workers can be re-assigned to other tasks.

## Work and rest time
Current research indicates that Vikings can only work for 12 hours a day. After 6PM, CALM Vikings will move into "rest mode", where they will attempt to satisfy their needs, like hunger and sleep. It's important to make sure that food is available in your ship's storage and that adequate housing is made available. Vikings with no place to sleep will simply stand outside and be unable to sleep. If a Viking's food or sleep needs reach 10, they will die. **Remember, death is bad, so it is important not to let Vikings die.**. You can inspect a Viking's current needs by clicking on them.

A helpful indicator has been placed at the bottom right hand corner of your screen to display the time, as well as whether it is time to work or rest.
